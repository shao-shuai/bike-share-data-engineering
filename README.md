Dimension tables

1. stations

   - station_id; string; unique identifier of station; Primary Key
   - station_name;
   - short_name;
   - station_latitude;
   - station_longitude;
   - station_address;
     - The raw data does not include address, the address is generated by using [Opencage](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/geocode-in-python) API
   - region_id;
   - capacity; int;
   - rental_methods; `not sure what datatype`
